- Objective: Demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and superiority of client-side calculations compared to server-side calculations.
- Implementation: Utilize 10,000 randomly generated bearings or allow user uploads for computations.
- Perform predefined calculations on both server-side and in the browser.
- Showcase and compare CPU usage, time consumption, and cost associated with each method.
- Highlight the advantages of client-side computations.
- Emphasize the significant benefits in terms of cost and efficiency.

# Interface
The user interface for this tech can be designed to include a button with additional functionality. Here’s a detailed description of how it could be implemented:
1.	UI Design:
▪	The main interface can consist of a clean and modern design, with a central content area and a button at the bottom.
▪	The content area can be divided into two panels, one for server-side calculations and another for client-side calculations.
▪	Each panel can display relevant information such as CPU usage, time consumption, and cost.
2.	Button Functionality:
▪	The button can have a label such as “Compare Calculations” or “Run Analysis.”
▪	On a single click, it triggers the execution of the predefined calculations for both server-side and client-side environments.
3.	Function Calls:
▪	On clicking the button, the web application can initiate the following function calls:
▪	serverSideCalculations():
◦	This function would send a request to the server-side API or backend to perform the predefined calculations with the uploaded or randomly generated bearings.
◦	It would record CPU usage, time consumption, and cost associated with these computations.
◦	The results can be displayed in the server-side calculations panel.
▪	clientSideCalculations():
◦	This function would execute the same predefined calculations within the browser using JavaScript or other client-side technologies.
◦	It would measure CPU usage, time consumption, and compute the cost associated with these computations.
◦	The results can be displayed in the client-side calculations panel.
